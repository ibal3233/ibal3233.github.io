                          The dissertation addresses enhancing network security in smart cities, 
                          focusing on using citizen-generated data with strict confidentiality and resilience against AI adversarial threats. 
                          It explores three critical research questions: developing privacy-preserving IDS training algorithms, leveraging big 
                          data to bolster IDS resilience, and evaluating the threat of adversarial examples in federated 
                          learning-based IDS in smart cities.

                        Day-ahead Energy Generation Prediction in Blockchain-based P2P Energy Trading system:
                        Many governments are reducing conventional energy production using natural gas or coal as they spread much 
                        CO2 to the atmosphere, which leads to global warming. Moreso, with a sharp increase in electricity demand, 
                        renewable energy sources are gaining more popularity around the world. 
                        <p>
                          Renewable energy sources such as solar energy offer one of the easiest ways of generating renewable energy as it can be done by 
                          anyone/household through installing solar panels in an open place such as house roofs. 
                          Therefore, the decentralized exchange of the generated energy by the household will provide huge 
                          economic benefits as well as optimize the flow of renewable energy.

                          However, the current conventional centralized energy trading makes it impossible for individuals 
                          (prosumers) to participate because third parties need to enable the transaction, which adds extra 
                          financial burden and discomfort. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                          To eradicate the need for third party through decentralization 
                          while ensuring non-tamperability, transparency, security and integrity of transaction, 
                          previous works have proposed the integration of blockchain systems into the trading system. 
                          However, to ensure the sustainability of blockchain technology for trading, there is a need to 
                          consider energy consumption and prediction in the system to enable planning about the energy demand. 
                          Thus, this paper aims to design and implement day-ahead power generation prediction in a blockchain-based 
                          P2P energy trading system. Hyperledger fabric was employed as the blockchain platform while 
                          long short-term memory (LSTM) was proposed for the prediction model in the system. 
                          The trading system and the prediction model yield significant performance and prove to be effective for 
                          deployment to enhance power management in planning to meet the energy demand.

                              Optimal EEG Locations for EEG Feature Extraction with Application to User's Intension using a Robust Neuro-Fuzzy System in BCI
                              Electroencephalogram (EEG) recording provides a new way to support human-machine communication. 
                              It allows us to analyze the neuro-dynamics of human cognition. Machine learning is powerful for EEG classification. 
                              In addition, machine learning can compensate for high variability of EEG when analyzing data in real-time. 
                              However, the optimal EEG electrode location must be prioritized to extract the most relevant features 
                              from brain wave data. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system model for the extraction of EEG 
                              data by training the optimal electrode location of EEG in a specific problem.

                              The proposed system is a fuzzy system and structurally uses a neural network. 
                              The fuzzy clustering method determines the optimal number of fuzzy rules using the features extracted from the EEG data. 
                              The parameters and weight values found in the process of determining the number of rules determined 
                              here must be tuned for optimization in the learning process. Genetic algorithms are used to obtain optimized parameters. 
                              We present useful results by using optimal rule numbers and non - symmetric membership 
                              function using EEG data for four movements with the right arm through various experiments.

                        <p>
                          Epilepsy remains one of the most common chronic neurological disorders; hence, there is a need further to 
                          investigate various models for the automatic detection of seizure activity. 
                          An effective detection model can be achieved by minimizing the complexity of the model in terms of trainable parameters 
                          while maintaining high accuracy. One way to achieve this is to select the minimum possible number of features.

                          In this paper, we propose a long short-term memory (LSTM) network for the classification of epileptic EEG signals. 
                          Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) removes noise and extracts 20 eigenvalue features.

                          The proposed method significantly reduces the number of trainable LSTM parameters required to attain high accuracy.

                      and regulate emotion through human-aware artificial intelligence. By understanding emotions mental diseases such as depression, 
                      autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and game addiction will be better managed as they are all associated with

                          One major and time-consuming task in fish production is obtaining an accurate estimate of the number of fish produced. 
                          In most Nigerian farms, fish counting is performed manually. Digital image processing (DIP) is an inexpensive solution, 
                          but its accuracy is affected by noise, overlapping fish, and interfering objects.

                          This study developed a catfish recognition and counting algorithm that introduces detection before counting and consists of 
                          six steps: image acquisition, pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, recognition, and counting. 
                          Images were acquired and pre-processed. The segmentation was performed by applying three methods: 
                          image binarization using Otsu thresholding, morphological operations using fill hole, dilation, and opening operations, 
                          and boundary segmentation using edge detection.

                      an artificial neural network (ANN) to perform the recognition. 
                      The new counting approach, based on the geometry of the fish, was applied to determine the number of fish and was found to 
                      be suitable for counting fish of any size and handling overlap. The accuracies of the segmentation algorithm, 
                      boundary pixel and Fourier descriptors (BDFD), and the proposed CH-FD method were 90.34%, 96.6%, and 100% respectively.

                                Air Conditioners and air conditioning systems are integral to almost every building and contribute a 
                                significant part of the total energy consumption. In Nigeria, heating and cooling appliances accounts 
                                for about 44% of utility bills. With the exponential increase in the use of cooling devices, 
                                there is a simultaneous increase in electrical power consumption and occurrence of health issues, 
                                such as building-related symptoms and sick building syndromes due to air conditioners. 
                                Hence, there is a need to fathom other ways of operating the air conditioning systems in other to 
                                minimize energy consumption and other health-related issues. 
                              </p>

                                In view of this, we have applied a Novel control method to regulate the operation of the air conditioning systems 
                                in offices and single rooms, based on the occupant's or resident thermal comfort as against the 
                                traditional method based on the indoor temperature. The control signal is based on the occupant's body temperature, 
                                obtained via sensors on a table within the office or room. This information is sent to a microcontroller (AT89C52) 
                                where it is compared with a reference temperature and the air conditioner is regulated accordingly. 
                                The system was evaluated using the body temperature of many people either "with normal" or "above normal" thermal states. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                The result of the evaluation shows that the system's response is faster in temperature regulation when used for subjects with 
                                body temperature "above normal" thermal state. Furthermore, the operational time of the new method is significantly less than 
                                that of the old (traditional) method which accounts for the reduction in the total energy consumption.

                          loss which were examined using packet generation rate of 1 to 50 packet/sec with a constant delay. GET requests was sent 
                          to the humidity and temperature sensor motes running CoAP servers, and the corresponding throughput were observed in each 
                          case per experiment, it was observed that there was a 10 packet per second increase before it finally dropped. 
                          This was because of the packet loss due to the increase in traffic. GET request was sent to motes to obtain the packet loss 
                          and the packet that were not acknowledged determined the packet loss.

                          In this study, the performance of the proposed model in terms of 
                          throughput and packet loss was studied and the expected results will aid in planning 6LoWPAN network, A transition flow 
                          diagram was evolved for this work to represent packet routing process.
